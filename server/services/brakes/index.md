# Brakes

We don’t need to tell you how important it is to have a working brake system- it’s an element of your car that can’t be taken for granted. It is crucial to get your brakes checked in regular intervals, at least twice a year. Undergoing these checks means that we can find any problems before they become a safety issue, and stop you from being able to use your car.

### How do I know if my brakes aren't working to their full potential?

A few common signs of faulty or worn brakes include:

- Handbrake not holding
- Handbrake light not turning off after releasing it
- Metallic grinding noise
- Longer stopping time
- Vehicle pulling to one side when brakes are applied
- Low brake fluid level
