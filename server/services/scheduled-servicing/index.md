# Scheduled Servicing

At DPL Motors, we customise our service to suit your budget and car type. Not only can we service European vehicles, but we can work on any make or model, whether it's a small car, SUV, 4WD, ute, van, family car or sports car.

Our logbook services are carried out in accordance with manufacturerâ€™s specifications and we replace all scheduled parts. We also carry out a full safety check, and every service comes with a 6month/10,000km warranty. Our European trained mechanics only use the best quality parts on your vehicle- parts that are manufactured to match or exceed the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM).

The service we provide helps to maintain your vehicle, and prevent unforeseen faults. It is the very minimum you should have performed on your car. In this service we replace your Engine Oil and Oil Filter, as well as check and report on the following:

- Brakes- Front and rear
- Tyre condition and thread depth
