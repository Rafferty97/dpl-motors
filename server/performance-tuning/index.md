# Performance Tuning

Car manufacturers often produce cars for worldwide sale, and it's for this reason that cars are released with the ability to survive extreme climates, different fuel qualities and other factors. In order to satisfy all of these standards, most manufacturers limit the engine's performance to a more conservative level. That's right! They lower the performance so that the engine can survive in rough conditions, but at DPL Motors, we can replace this lost power with our remapping services.

At DPL, we specialise in performance tuning, remapping via on-board diagnostic (OBD) ports, and general tuning. We pride ourselves in being able to do so without spoiling the fundamental reasons for buying a turbo powered vehicle- we believe that reliability and of course, fuel economy should never be compromised.

Our aim when creating performance chips, diesel remapping via OBD port or general turbo tuning is to gain the perfect increased power curve and fuel economy improvements. DPL Motors retains all the safety parameters originally programmed into the engine management by the manufacturer so as to protect your engine and drive train from damage.

A tune remap at DPL Motors will give you the following gains:

- Increased Horsepower
- More Torque
- Improved Throttle Response
- Smoother Power Delivery
- Safer Overtaking
- Guaranteed Better Fuel Economy

These gains are achieved through meticulous matching of parameters such as boost pressure, fuel delivery rates and pump timing, along with adjustments to maps limiting torque, throttle response and top speed. All of this information is stored in the engine's ECU calibration file, where we carefully optimise it to our exact standards, then program back into your ECU. The vehicle is then comprehensively tested before you collect it, for your safety and satisfaction.  

When you drive away with your remapped car, you also get:

- A 30 day money back guarantee
- A lifetime warranty on all remaps
- Improved fuel economy guarantee on all diesel remaps
